## Abstract
Microsoft recently announced the Azure Cognitive Service, Personalizer, aimed at democratizing real world reinforcement learning for context personalization. Its goal is to make reinforcement learning accessible to everyone, not just machine learning experts. Personalizer is the result of a successful partnership between Microsoft Research and Azure Cognitive Services aimed at rapid technology transfer and innovation.

In this workshop you will learn the theory behind contextual bandits and how this applies to content personalization. We will walk you through setting up the service, writing your first application, and optimizing the policy using offline optimization.
